Memory Lane Map â€” for Maxine & Luke

Static, tablet-first web experience. Ten clickable nodes unlock photos, text, and tiny interactions. Ends with confetti, music, and a romantic note.

Quick start
- Place assets:
  - `assets/images/scene1_cabog_cabog.jpg`
  - `assets/images/scene2_school.jpg`
  - `assets/images/scene3_tala.jpg`
  - `assets/images/scene4_tala_2.jpg`
  - `assets/images/scene5_us.jpg`
  - `assets/images/scene6_restaurant.jpg`
  - `assets/images/scene7_cafe_hanan.jpg`
  - `assets/audio/song.mp3` (optional; otherwise the fallback URL is used)
- Open `index.html` to preview.
- Deploy to Netlify (no build command). Publish directory is project root.

Personalization
- Edit scene copy and image paths in `script.js` (`scenes` array).
- Colors/typography in `styles.css`.
- Default audio volume in `script.js`.

Notes
- Works on tablets, phones, and desktops; fully static.
- Uses GSAP and canvas-confetti from CDN.
